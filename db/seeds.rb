# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Hero.create(id: 1, name: "Kamala Khan", super_name: "Ms. Marvel")
# Hero.create(id: 2, name: "Doreen Green", super_name: "Squirrel Girl")
# Hero.create(id: 3, name: "Gwen Stacy", super_name: "Spider-Gwen")

# Power.create(id: 1, name: "super strength", description: "gives the wielder super-human strengths")
# Power.create(id: 2, name: "flight", description: "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed")

# HeroPower.create(strength: "Average", power_id: 1, hero_id: 3)
# HeroPower.create(strength: "Strong", power_id: 2, hero_id: 1)
HeroPower.create(strength: "Weak", power_id: 3, hero_id: 2)
